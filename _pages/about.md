I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Operations Research at Columbia University. I completed my M.S.E. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University in 2023. My thesis, titled "Globally Optimal Matching of Astronomy Catalogs Using Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Programming and Constrained Clustering," was advised by Prof. Amitabh Basu and Prof. Tamás Budavári.

My interests include combinatorial optimization, control theory, and machine learning.
